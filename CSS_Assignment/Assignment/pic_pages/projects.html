          <h2>Animations in Astronomy</h2> Animations in the field of astrophysics play a
          very crucial role in that they enthrall the general audiences and help
          promote the fieldX while also providing researchers with a way to
          visualise complex theories that are otherwise either simplified or
          discarded. As the processing power of computers has increased manifold
          over the yearsX it has become easier to mimic astrophysical systems
          without too much manual effort. 8n this projectX we will create
          animations which could be automated using python that would allow us
          to recreate realistic astrophysical scenarios. <br />
          Objectives for this project :
          <ul>
            <li>
              Learn basics of an industrial standard animation software Tool
              (Blender)
            </li>
            <li>
              Procedurally generate realistic physics animation/simulation
            </li>
            <li>Learn how to read astronomy data files using Python</li>
            <li>Use Python to simulate simplified condition (in matplotlib)</li>
            <li>Integrate python interface with blender</li>
            <li>Optimise the python code</li>
          </ul>
